## :star2: About the Project

This project is the first venture we had into MySQL, and it uses CRUD operations to store different information for projects that the user can complete. It is fully capable of 
Creating, Reading, Updating, and Deleting any of the information.

This was the main part of our MySQL assignments for weeks 7 through 11 of my Back End bootcamp.

This project uses Java as well as MySQL.

My favorite thing about this project being able to see it grow to perform the different CRUD operations week by week, and although we still used Eclipse, it was very nice to get 
familiar with DBeaver as well as MySQL Workbench.
